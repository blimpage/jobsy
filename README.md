Oh hi! This is the code for a scraper that runs daily [on Morph.io](https://morph.io/blimpage/jobsy). It searches for new job listings from a few companies, and sends an email (via Sendgrid) to a nominated email address if any new job listings are found.

I hope none of those companies find this code and use it to decide whether to hire me, because uhhhh it's not my finest work.
